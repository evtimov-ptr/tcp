# TCP/SYN Flood
TCP/SYN Flood
The idea is very simple. SYN queue flood attack takes advantage of the TCP protocol’s “three-way handshake”, the client send a “SYN”, the server answer a “SYN, ACK”, and the client do nothing but leave the connection half opened. This action will repete again and again to consume the server’s resources as much as possible.
